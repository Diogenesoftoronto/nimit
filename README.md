# Nimmits

A library for standardizing and linting commits.

Considering creating this for Golang as well, but I believe Nim is more suited to scripting.

## Getting started

You will need to install nim. This program allows you to emit
a js version of the code so that you can stick with node as a dependency and not add a new one. However, the preference is that you will use Nim directly and include it in your tool pipeline.

This tool is highly inspired by husky and cbeam's [article](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).
